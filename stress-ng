#Run stress-ng through all tests, with verbose output, for 1 minute each.  Exclude the madvise test and it just stalls and never finishes. Silently skips not supported tests.
stress-ng --seq 0 -v -t 1m -x madvise --skip-silent

Can make it through all tests with above command w/o crashing Haiku or KDL.  A few of the test do crash, but not the system itself.
